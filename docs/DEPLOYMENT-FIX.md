# Deployment & GitHub Issue Assignment Fix

## Deployment Issue
The previous deployment link `https://protostudio.replit.app/` is not working. 

### Solution:
1. Click the **Deploy** button in Replit again
2. Wait for new deployment URL
3. Update README.md with new working URL

## GitHub Issue Assignment

### Problem: 
You cannot assign someone by email - GitHub only works with usernames.

### Solution Options:

#### Option 1: Get GitHub Username
Ask the developer: "What's your GitHub username?" 
Then in the issue:
- Click gear icon next to "Assignees"
- Type their GitHub username (not email)

#### Option 2: Mention in Issue Description
Add this to your issue description:
```
@[their-github-username] - requesting code review for ProtoLab
```

#### Option 3: Share Repository Link
Send them:
- Repository: https://github.com/mdundebe/protomdu
- Issue link after you create it
- Ask them to self-assign or comment

### Current Status:
- Frontend rendering issue: FIXED
- Application running: âœ“
- Need new deployment URL
- Need developer's GitHub username for assignment

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy application (get new URL)
2. Get developer's GitHub username
3. Update issue with working demo link
4. Assign developer to issue
