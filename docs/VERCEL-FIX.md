# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The deployment is failing due to package.json path errors and build configuration issues.

## Solution
Use these **corrected settings** in Vercel:

### Build Configuration:
- **Framework Preset:** Node.js (not "Other")
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** Leave EMPTY
- **Install Command:** `npm install`
- **Node.js Version:** 18.x

### Alternative Simple Build:
If still failing, try these settings:
- **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Install Command:** `npm ci`

## Root Cause
The error shows npm can't find package.json in the expected location during the build process.

## Steps to Fix:
1. Delete the current failed deployment
2. Create a new deployment with Node.js framework
3. Use the settings above
4. Deploy again

This should resolve the package.json path issues and successful deploy your ProtoLab app.
