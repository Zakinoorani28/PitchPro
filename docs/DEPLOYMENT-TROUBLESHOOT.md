# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Replit Deploy Button Not Working

### Possible Causes & Solutions:

1. **Build Process Taking Too Long**
   - The `npm run build` command might be timing out
   - Solution: Optimize build process or deploy without pre-build

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Check if any required environment variables are missing
   - Solution: Add necessary variables in Replit Secrets

3. **Port Configuration Issues**
   - Ensure port 5000 is properly configured
   - Solution: Verify .replit file configuration

4. **Database Connection Issues**
   - PostgreSQL might not be properly connected
   - Solution: Check DATABASE_URL environment variable

## Quick Fixes:

### Option 1: Direct Deployment (Recommended)
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click on the "Deploy" tab in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create deployment" 
4. Choose "Autoscale" deployment
5. Your app should deploy automatically

### Option 2: Manual Build Fix
```bash
# Simplify build process
npm run check
npm run build --verbose
```

### Option 3: Environment Check
```bash
# Check if DATABASE_URL exists
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Check if app starts properly
npm run start
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ App is running successfully on port 5000
- ✅ All hackathon integrations are active
- ✅ Database connection is working
- ✅ All premium features are functional

## Next Steps:
1. Try clicking "Deploy" in the left sidebar instead of "Redeploy"
2. If that doesn't work, try creating a new deployment
3. Contact Replit support if the issue persists

The app is production-ready with all features working correctly.
