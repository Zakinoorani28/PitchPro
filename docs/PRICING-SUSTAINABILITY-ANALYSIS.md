## Current Platform Issues & Solutions

### Missing Document Upload Feature

I'm implementing document intelligence integration:

```typescript
// Enhanced pitch generation with document support
interface PitchGenerationRequest {
  businessIdea: string;
  industry: string;
  target: string;
  supportingDocuments?: File[];
  websiteUrl?: string;
  additionalContext?: string;
}
```
