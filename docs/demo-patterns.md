5. Payment Processing (10 transactions/min)
```

## Demo Pattern 4: Network Resilience Testing

### Offline-First Architecture
```
1. Service Worker Implementation:
   - Cache critical assets
   - Queue offline actions
   - Sync when connection restored

2. Progressive Web App Features:

## Automated Testing Suite

### Unit Tests
```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('Pitch Generator', () => {
  test('generates slides from user input', async () => {
    const input = {
      company: 'Test Corp',
      industry: 'fintech',
      problem: 'Payment issues',
      solution: 'Mobile payments'
    };
    const result = await generatePitchDeck(input);
    expect(result.slides).toHaveLength(8);
    expect(result.title).toBe('Test Corp');
  });
});

describe('Template Customization', () => {
  test('applies theme colors correctly', async () => {
    const theme = { primary: '#D97706', secondary: '#92400E' };
    const deck = await applyTheme(baseDeck, theme);
    expect(deck.styling.colors.primary).toBe('#D97706');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```javascript
describe('Payment Integration', () => {
  test('processes M-Pesa payment successfully', async () => {
    const payment = {
      amount: 499,
      phone: '+254712345678',
      requestId: 123
    };
    const result = await initializePayment(payment);
    expect(result.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(result.data.link).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```
